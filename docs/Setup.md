To use the GOG API extension you should follow these steps:

1. Import this GOG API extension into your project, if you haven't done that already.
2. The GOG Launcher needs to be **installed** , **running** and with an account **logged in** ([official site](https://www.gog.com/galaxy)).
3. Download GOG SDK (v1.150) from GOG's [developer portal](https://devportal.gog.com/welcome) and extract the contents of the zip into a directory of your choice (e.g.: `C:\GOG_sdk`).<br>

6. The options are split in two sections **Building Properties** and **Game Properties** . The first one is a folder path that should point to the extracted folder of step 3, the second section will allow you to configure all the settings that are required for running and publishing a game to GOG Store.
